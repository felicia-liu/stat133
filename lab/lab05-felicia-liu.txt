2.1) Inspecting a Directory
Use the command ls to list the contents in your current directory
$ ls

Now try ls -l to list the contents in your current directory in long format
$ ls -l

Look at the man documentation of ls to find out how to list the contents in reverse order
$ ls -r

How would you list the contents in long format arranged by time?
$ ls -l -t

Find out how to use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .txt
$ ls *.txt

Use the wildcard * to list all the files with extension .csv in reverse order
$ ls *.csv -r

You can use the character ? to represent a single character: e.g. ls mid?.csv. Find out how to use the wilcard ? to list .csv files with names made of 4 characters (e.g. mid1.csv, snow.csv)
$ ls ????.csv

The command ls *[1]*.csv should list .csv files with names containing the number 1 (e.g. mid1.csv, minutes1.csv). Adapt the command to list .csv files with names containing the number 2.
$ ls *[2]*.csv

Find out how to list files with names containing any number.
$ ls *[[:digit:]]*

Invoke the command history and see what happens
$ history

2.2) Moving Files
Inside stat133-lab05 create a directory data
$ mkdir data

Change directory to data
$ cd data

Create a directory txt-files
$ mkdir txt-files

Create a directory csv-files
$ mkdir csv-files

Use the command mv to move the bread.txt file to the folder txt-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that bread.txt is now inside txt-files.
$ mv bread.txt ~/stat133-lab05/data/txt-files
$ ls ~/stat133-lab05/data/txt-files

Use the wildcard * to move all the .txt files to the directory txt-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .txt files are inside txt-files.
$ mv *.txt ~/stat133-lab05/data/txt-files
$ ls ~/stat133-lab05/data/txt-files

Use the wildcard * to move all the .csv files to the directory csv-files. Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .csv files are inside csv-files.
$ mv *.csv ~/stat133-lab05/data/csv-files
$ ls ~/stat133-lab05/data/csv-files

2.3) Copying Files
Go back to the parent directory stat133-lab05

Create a directory copies
$ mkdir copies

Use the command cp to copy the bread.txt file (the one inside the folder txt-files) to the copies directory
$ cp bread.txt bread-copy.txt
$ mv bread-copy.txt ~/stat133-lab05/copies

Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that bread.txt is now inside copies.
$ ls ~/stat133-lab05/copies

Use the wildcard * to copy all the .txt files in the directory copies
$ cp *.txt ~/stat133-lab05/copies

Without changing directories, use ls to confirm that all the .txt files are now inside copies.
$ ls ~/stat133-lab05/copies

Use the wildcard * to copy all the .csv files in the directory copies
$ cp *.csv ~/stat133-lab05/copies

2.4) Renaming and Deleting Files
Change to the directory copies
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd copies

Use the command mv to rename the file bread.txt as bread-recipe.
$ mv bread.txt bread-recipe

Rename the file cars.csv as autos.csv
$ mv cars.csv autos.csv

Rename the file btaco.txt as breakfast-taco.txt
$ mv btaco.txt breakast-taco.txt

Change to the parent directory (i.e. stat133-lab05)
$ cd ..

Rename the directory copies as copy-files
$ mv copies copy-files

Find out how to use the rm command to delete the .csv files that are in copy-files
$ rm *.csv

Find out how to use the rm command to delete the directory copy-files
$ rm -r copy-files

List the contents of the directory txt-files displaying the results in reverse (alphabetical) order
$ cd data
$ cd txt-files
$ ls -r
